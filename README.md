[JAN/11/2021] Note: Due to the file size limit of Github(< 25Mb), you need to download the synthetic traces (generated by SOFI2D) from the release(v1.0.0) and put it into the root directory of this package. The filenames are <evt1_vy.su> and <evt1_vx.su>.

This code is a reproducible code for the figures in Zhang, 2022 (in prep.).

This code relys on the open-source package of jsonlab (https://github.com/fangq/jsonlab.git), SeismicLab (http://seismic-lab.physics.ualberta.ca/), and processRFmatlab (https://github.com/iwbailey/processRFmatlab.git). You can visit their website to get more information. Before you start running this code, you could install all of them and modify the path to where you have just installed or just utilize the useful codes extracted from the packages.

Simulation is conducted with the 2D finite-difference code of SOFI2D (https://git.scc.kit.edu/GPIAG-Software/SOFI2D.git). Radon transform denoising is based on this paper «Chen, 2018, GEO, Automatic velocity analysis using high-resolution hyperbolic Radon transform». Real data example is from Hi-CLIMB network downloaded from IRIS.
